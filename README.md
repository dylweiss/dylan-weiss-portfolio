Featured Projects:  

1. Observe+ App  
Tech: Javascript  
Focus: AI Therapy Notetaking App  
What it does: Observe+ makes writing session notes faster and safer. It allows behavior analysts to finish in seconds through tapping pre-saved labels and filling in provided templates and immediately autosaves progress.  
Why it matters: Session notes are a time-sinking, repetitive burden, forcing a choice between client safety and real-time documentation, and leading to constant fear of data loss for behavior analysts.  
Key contributions:  
Calendar Dashboard, featuring intuitive viewsto navigate all sessions  
Dropdown and add-on buttons choosing words based on frequency algorithm

1. R2 — Real Estate AI Analyst Tool  
Tech: Python, React, TypeScript, SQL, RNNs  
Focus: AI-driven property evaluation & lease parsing  
What it does:  
Built a real estate analytics platform that evaluates properties based on similarity in size and location, includes an AI chatbot, and uses RNN models to parse and analyze commercial leases across NYC.  
Why it matters:  
This project exposed me to the same challenges faced by housing operators: messy data, client configuration complexity, and the need for explainable AI outputs.
Key Contributions:  
Designed similarity matching model for property valuation  
Built React interface for AI-assisted workflows  
Implemented RNN-based lease parsing engine

2. Bankruptcy Prediction Machine Learning Model  
Tech: Python, scikit-learn, boosting, data visualization  
What it does:  
Developed a machine learning model to predict corporate bankruptcy risk over time using historical financial data.  
Why it matters:  
Demonstrates strong data preprocessing, feature engineering, and communicating technical findings through visualizations.  
Key Contributions:  
Built preprocessing + boosting pipelines  
Visualized prediction accuracy using heatmaps & charts  
Tuned model performance across time horizons
